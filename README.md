# CylinderCollider
A cylinder collider approximation made of primitive colliders.

## Description
**CylinderCollider** is a compound collider made of **BoxColliders**. It's usage is limited in playmode as it could make it more computationally demanding.

Project contains benchmark scene to compare mesh-based cylinder collider equivalents with primitive-collider-based colliders.
